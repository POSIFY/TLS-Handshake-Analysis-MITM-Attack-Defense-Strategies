# TLS Handshake Analysis MITM Attack-Defense Strategies

### Project Description

This repository documents my findings and observations as I explore Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks and defense strategies, including methodology, underlying technologies, and tools used during MITM and session hijacking simulations.

I've always been fascinated by how systems communicate. Through this research, I’ve come to understand that data is most vulnerable while in transit, as it may pass through compromised networks, rogue access points, untrusted devices, or attacker-controlled infrastructure.
The goal of this project is to help individuals and organizations gain a clearer understanding of how MITM attacks operate — and more importantly — how to better protect transmitted data from unauthorized access.

### Scope of Work

1. TLS handshake observation and analysis
2. MITM attack simulation in a controlled lab environment
3. Session hijacking techniques and prevention
4. Defensive strategies, detection methods, and mitigation approaches
5. Tools, methodologies, and explanations provided at point of use

### Lab Environment & Tools
